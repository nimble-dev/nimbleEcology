# Distributions for Ecological Models in 'nimble'

This repository provides user-defined distributions that can be used in NIMBLE models for common population ecology statistical models. These include distributions for:

* basic capture-recapture distributions (Cormack-Jolly-Seber),
* hidden Markov model distributions for multi-state and multi-event capture-recapture models,
* occupancy models,
* dynamic occupancy models, and
* N-mixture models.

Community contributions or suggestions for other needs are welcome.

Some of these models were used (in slightly different forms) in:

[D. Turek, P. de Valpine, and C. J. Paciorek. 2016. Efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for hierarchical hidden Markov models. Environmental and Ecological Statistics 4:549-564](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10651-016-0353-z).
